                        <p>This project is a recreation of the Apple homepage from summer 2023.  The project highlights my ability to create a webpage from a given design which is a core requirement for front-end developers.  Specifically, it uses both HTML and CSS.  The raw code for this project is available to view on my GitHub profile.  I chose to recreate the Apple website as it is iconic in both every day society as well as the tech industry.  Everyone will know what they are looking at when the see the website.  Additionally, recreating websites is a classic sample project on a starter front-end developer profile.</p>

                        <p>Project 2 is a sample Degree Completion Plan form that I created for my current job as an Academic Advisor.  Students would complete this form and a copy would be emailed to the student and their advisor.  This would streamline and unify the mandatory Degree Completion Plan process that all students must complete at Towson University. I chose this project as it was designed from scratch but integrates the Towson University design theme.  This would be a requirement for many projects as a front-end developer.  Additionally, this project highlights creating a form which is a needed skill prospective employers would expect to see.</p>

                        <p>This project incorporates HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into one project.  It uses the design features from an existing brand, Movement Gym, while creating a new feature for their website.  The feature is a social page where users can create a profile to meet other climbers for networking and belay partners.  The JavaScript allows users to create and delete information which is stored to their local computer.  This is a common feature of modern websites and potential employers would be interested to see my solution to this task.  While there are more advanced JavaScript projects, it is also important to highlight foundational projects.</p>

                        <p>For Project 4 I recreated the Chewy pet supply website homepage.  While I also created the Apple homepage, each page highlights different HTML and CSS skills and techniques.  Additionally, I believe that it is important to show that you can recreate skills in various formats.  The code for this project is also visible in my GitHub profile so that potential employers can see my approach and the different skills I used for my projects.  I chose to recreate the Chewy website as it is a well known e-commerce website and e-commerce is a common requirement for potential front-end developer jobs.</p>

                        <p>For my final project, I built a web based application to check the weather in major cities around the globe.  This project utilizes JavaScript and specifically an API to pull weather data based on the city entered into the search bar.  APIs are used to consolidate data from across the internet into one location and are a common tasks that front-end developers must perform.  My weather app, while a basic and commonly used project, displays that I have a solid understanding of JavaScript foundations.  This skill can be transferred to other APIs a potential employer is looking to add to their website.</p>
